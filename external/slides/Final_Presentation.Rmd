## Introduction

Package: NatureWave

What it does?

- Package which analyzes processed Sound Index data for NDSI (Normalized Sound Index)
- Assesses the correlations between sound indices and ecological variables of interest taking into account different landscape metrics for Massachusets at different scales of influence.
- Evaluates the importance of ecological variables at multiple scales and predicts NDSI values accross the entire study area. 

Objective: 

- Evaluate the relationship between landscape structure and acoustic community diversity in a highly fragmented and human dominated forested landscape in Massachusetts. 

- Inform conservation and planning startegies to facilitate green development

## Acoustic Indices

NDSI: Ratio index of Anthrophony (Human Noises) to Biophony (Animal Noises)
The Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), from REAL (http://www.real.msu.edu) and Kasten, et al. 2012, seeks to “estimate the level of anthropogenic disturbance on the soundscape by computing the ratio of human-generated (anthrophony) to biological (biophony) acoustic components found in field collected sound samples”.

NDSI = (biophony - anthrophony)/ (biophony + anthrophony )

Notes on Sound Indices and What They Measure: 
Amplitude: intensity of sound (usually measured as decibels). 
Spectrum: change in amplitude across frequencies.
Spectrogram: frequency change over time. 
Envelope: change in the amplitude of sound over time

## Data

- Conservation Assessment and Prioritization System (CAPS) Landscape Metrics

Statewide Massachusetts Assessment: November 2011
http://jamba.provost.ads.umass.edu/web/caps2011/CAPS2011data.htm

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}

Imperv <- raster("D:\\rproject\\lc2500_tiffiles\\lc2500_imperv.tif")
Connectdness <- raster("D:\\rproject\\lc2500_tiffiles\\lc2500_connect.tif")
Structure <- raster("D:\\rproject\\lc2500_tiffiles\\lc2500_structure.tif")
Traffic <- raster("D:\\rproject\\lc2500_tiffiles\\lc2500_traffic.tif")

# Create a raster stack
my_stack <- stack(Imperv, Connectdness, Structure, Traffic)
names(my_stack) <- c("Imperv", "Connectdness", "Structure", "Traffic")

plot(my_stack)

```

-Dr. Florencia Sangermano collected recordings at 11 different sites in Central Mass. over the course of 3 months between June and August. 


## Methods

Linear Regression

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
# Insert chunk of code here
```


Random Forest 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
# Create RandomForest Model
set.seed(100)
rf_2500 <- randomForest(NDSI ~., data=DS_2500_scaled, mtry= 2, importance = TRUE, na.action=na.omit)

randomForest::varImpPlot(rf_2500, main = "Variable Importance at 2500 buffer level")

```

Preditive modeling


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
# Use raster::predict to predict NDSI values across the landscape
ndsi_pred <- raster::predict(object = new_stack, model=rf_2500, type = 'response', index = 5)
ndsi_pred
```


## Results from Linear Regresion

- Preliminary work


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
# using his code and external site 
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/slides/figures/NDVI_NDSIFinal.png"))

knitr::include_graphics("D:\\GeoSpaaR\\naturewave\\external\\slides\\figures\\NDBIRSquared_Final.png")

knitr::include_graphics("D:\\GeoSpaaR\\naturewave\\external\\slides\\figures\\NDVI_NDSIRsquared.png")

knitr::include_graphics("D:\\GeoSpaaR\\naturewave\\external\\slides\\figures\\NDVI_NDSIFinal.png")

```

## Results from ¨Predictive Modeling

## Conclusions

- The scale of best influence for NDSI values is at 2500 m buffer from the sampling location

- IMperviousness and Traffic are the most important variables at predicting NDSI values

Future work:

- Test further variables such as ecological integrity and micro climate alterations
